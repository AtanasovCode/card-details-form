## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library



### What I learned

I learned how to use React Hooks, more specifically, the useState hook. 

Other then that, I learned how to set initial values for the input fields, how to conditionally render said 
values based on the value of the input fields and how to validate the input fields. 

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```
  const initialValues = [
        {name: "Jane Appleseed"},
        {number: handleCardNumber("0000000000000000")},
        {month: "00"},
        {year: "00"},
    ]
```

```
  <div className="exp-date">
    {!expMonth ? initialValues.map(initial => initial.month) : expMonth}/{!expYear ? initialValues.map(initial => initial.year) : expYear}
  </div>
```


### Useful resources

If you are interested in learning React I would strongly recommend you start with the official React docs ->
[reactjs.org](https://reactjs.org/)
